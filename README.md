# Ransomware
This is a simple C program to encrypt a file and decrypt if you have the key (like ransomwares do).

The file is encrypted based on RotX, the X value is generated by a rand().

You need to guess the key number to decrypt the file (rand() use a pseudo-random number generator, so you can find the value easily).
